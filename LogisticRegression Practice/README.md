# ðŸŽ“ Student Pass Prediction using Logistic Regression

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project uses **Logistic Regression** to predict whether a student will **pass or fail** based on the number of hours they study. It covers core machine learning concepts like binary classification, sigmoid activation, and decision boundary visualization.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset  
**Name**: Simulated Dataset (can be replaced with UCI Student Performance Dataset)  
**Features Used**:  
- **Study Hours**: Number of hours a student studies daily  
**Target**:  
- **Passed**: 1 if student passed, 0 if failed  

## ðŸ§± Technologies Used  
- Python  
- numpy, pandas  
- scikit-learn  
- matplotlib  

## ðŸš€ Steps Performed  
- Data Simulation or Loading  
- Preprocessing  
- Model Training â€“ Logistic Regression  
- Probability Prediction using Sigmoid Function  
- Visualization â€“ Sigmoid Curve & Decision Boundary  

## ðŸ“Š Model Outputs  
- Sigmoid curve plotted for probability of passing vs. study hours  
- Decision boundary shown where model switches from fail to pass (typically at 0.5)  

## ðŸ§  Notes  
- Great beginner-friendly project to understand how classification works using logistic regression.  
- Easy to extend with real-world datasets or additional features like attendance, sleep hours, etc.
