# 🧠 100 Days of AI Challenge

Welcome to my **100 Days of AI** challenge!

This repository will serve as a daily log of my journey as I explore and build projects in **Artificial Intelligence**, **Machine Learning**, and **AI-powered applications**.

## 📅 What's Inside

I’ll be uploading code, notebooks, datasets, and documentation for each day of the challenge. From simple ML models to advanced AI agents and chatbots — everything I work on will be shared here.

Stay tuned for daily updates! 🚀

## 📌 Objective

To consistently learn, build, and share projects in AI for 100 days — with the goal of becoming better at AI and launching meaningful, income-generating applications.
